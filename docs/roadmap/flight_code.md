# LiteAero Flight Component — Roadmap

LiteAero Flight is a separable software system. It is not a subsystem of LiteAero Sim. It resides
in the `liteaero-flight` sibling repository (consumed by LiteAero Sim via `add_subdirectory`). The
repo split is in progress — see [liteaero-flight-migration-plan.md](liteaero-flight-migration-plan.md)
for the step-by-step record. Architecture and component boundaries are defined in
`docs/architecture/system/future/`.

**Item process.** All items follow a documentation-first process:

1. Architecture and design documents are produced and reviewed.
2. Authorization to begin implementation is granted.
3. Implementation follows TDD — a failing test is written before every production code change.
4. All implementation items include simulation scenarios and automated tests sufficient for
   integration testing, demonstration, and investigation of algorithmic alternatives.

## FC-1. Repository Setup

✅ **In Progress** — Steps 0–3 complete. See [liteaero-flight-migration-plan.md](liteaero-flight-migration-plan.md) for the full record.

CMake targets and their migration status:

| CMake target | C++ namespace | Contents | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `liteaero::log` | `liteaero::log` | `ILogger`, logging sinks | ✅ Complete (Step 2) |
| `liteaero::control` | `liteaero::control` | `DynamicElement`, `SisoElement` | ✅ Partial (Step 3) — Filter hierarchy, Integrator, Derivative, RateLimit, Limit, SISOPIDFF pending |
| `liteaero::terrain` | `liteaero::terrain` | Terrain mesh types, `V_Terrain` | Not started (Step 8) |
| Shared interface target (name TBD) | — | `AircraftCommand`, `KinematicStateSnapshot`, `NavigationState`, sensor measurement structs | Not started (Step 7) |
| `liteaero::nav` | `liteaero::nav` | Navigation filter, wind/flow-angle estimators | Not started (Step 9) |
| `liteaero::guidance` | `liteaero::guidance` | Path guidance, vertical guidance, park tracking | Not started |
| `liteaero::autopilot` | `liteaero::autopilot` | Autopilot inner loop | Not started |
| `liteaero::perception` | `liteaero::perception` | Vision navigator, lidar terrain estimator | Not started |
| `liteaero::mission_autonomy` | `liteaero::mission_autonomy` | Link budget estimator | Not started |

LiteAero Sim already consumes `liteaero-flight` via `add_subdirectory` and all LiteAero Sim tests
pass against the migrated targets. Remaining steps migrate further subsystems, add shared interface
types, and eventually verify the full stack end-to-end.

## FC-2. Gain Scheduling — Design

`Gain<T, NumAxes>` currently holds template parameters for value type and scheduling axis
count, but the scheduling logic is unimplemented. This item defines the full gain scheduling
architecture. Gain scheduling is a general-purpose library capability used beyond PID loops —
it may parameterize model coefficients, limits, or other algorithm inputs. Fundamentally, a
gain is an object that produces a value parameterized by the current aircraft state. Within a
PID it is a multiplicative coefficient, but it may also enter an algorithm as an additive
term or in other ways.

### Scope to Define

- **Lookup methods** — interpolation strategies (rectilinear table bilinear,
  nearest-neighbor, polynomial fit) and how they are selected.
- **Axis dimensions** — how `NumAxes` maps to physical scheduling variables (airspeed,
  altitude, angle of attack); how axes are labeled and units enforced.
- **Lookup domain constraint functions** — how constraint functions ensure lookup occurs
  only within the valid domain of the scheduling inputs.
- **Lookup parameterization** — which flight condition and aircraft configuration values
  are available as scheduling axes.
- **Runtime update** — how a scheduled gain is evaluated at each step given the current
  scheduling variable values; whether evaluation is synchronous with `SISOPIDFF::step()`
  or driven externally.
- **Serialization** — how the gain table is stored and restored (JSON + proto).
- **Initialization** — whether the gain table is loaded from a file, embedded in config
  JSON, or populated programmatically.

### Deliverables

Design authority document at `docs/architecture/gain_scheduling.md`.
Do not implement in this item.

---

## FC-3. Gain Scheduling — Implementation

Implement the design produced in FC-2. Follow TDD: write failing tests before production code.

---

## FC-4. Autopilot Gain Design — Python Tooling

Python workflow that derives autopilot control gains from the aircraft model. Prerequisite
for FC-5 (`Autopilot`) — the C++ implementation is parameterized by gains computed here.

Scope to be defined when this item is scheduled. Expected to use Python control-system
libraries (`python-control`, `scipy.signal`) applied to linearized models extracted from
`Aircraft` trim and `AeroCoeffEstimator` outputs.

---

## FC-5. Autopilot — Inner Loop Knobs-Mode Tracking

`Autopilot` implements the inner closed-loop layer. It tracks pilot-style set point commands
corresponding to "knobs" modes — altitude hold, vertical speed hold, heading hold, and roll
attitude hold. Guidance (FC-7) is the outer loop that wraps around it and supplies set point
commands. Control gains are derived by the Python gain design workflow (FC-4). The autopilot
must support simulation use cases (reset and initialization to arbitrary conditions for batch
testing) as well as deployment as flight software.

Namespace: `liteaero::autopilot`. Derives from `DynamicElement`.

### Interface Sketch — Autopilot

*To be defined during design. Inputs will include `KinematicStateSnapshot` (or
`NavigationState`), `AtmosphericState`, and a set point struct (target altitude, target
vertical speed, target heading, target roll attitude). Output is `AircraftCommand`.*

### Tests

- Altitude hold: starting from a displaced altitude, output drives altitude error to zero
  within the expected settling time.
- Heading hold: starting from a heading offset, output drives heading error to zero without
  overshoot beyond a specified bound.
- Roll attitude hold: commanded roll angle is tracked with correct steady-state and transient.
- Vertical speed hold: commanded climb rate is tracked correctly.
- JSON and proto round-trips preserve filter states.
- Reset and re-initialization to arbitrary conditions produces correct initial output.

## FC-6. Path Representation — `V_PathSegment`, `PathSegmentHelix`, `Path`

Namespace: `liteaero::guidance`. A `Path` is an ordered sequence of `V_PathSegment` objects.
Each segment exposes a cross-track error, along-track distance, and desired heading at a
query position. The initial concrete segment type is `PathSegmentHelix` (a straight line is a
degenerate helix with infinite radius).

### Interface Sketch — Path

```cpp
namespace liteaero::guidance {

struct PathQuery {
    Eigen::Vector3f position_NED_m;
    float heading_rad;
};

struct PathResponse {
    float crosstrack_error_m;     // positive = right of path
    float along_track_m;          // distance from segment start
    float desired_heading_rad;    // commanded heading at query point
    float desired_altitude_m;
    bool  segment_complete;       // true when along_track_m >= segment_length_m
};

class V_PathSegment {
public:
    virtual PathResponse query(const PathQuery& q) const = 0;
    virtual float length_m() const = 0;
    virtual ~V_PathSegment() = default;
};

} // namespace liteaero::guidance
```

### Tests — `PathSegmentHelix`

- On a straight segment (infinite radius), cross-track error equals the perpendicular
  distance from the line.
- At the midpoint of a circular arc, `desired_heading_rad` is tangent to the arc.
- `segment_complete` is false before the end and true after `along_track_m >= length_m`.

### Tests — `Path`

- A path with two segments advances to the second segment when the first is complete.
- `Path::query()` delegates to the active segment.

---

## FC-7. Guidance — `PathGuidance`, `VerticalGuidance`, `ParkTracking`

Guidance is the outer loop that wraps around `Autopilot`. It converts path and altitude
errors into set point commands (target altitude, vertical speed, heading, roll attitude) that
are fed to `Autopilot::step()`. Each guidance class derives from `DynamicElement` and
implements the full component lifecycle. Namespace: `liteaero::guidance`.

### `PathGuidance` — Lateral Path Tracking

Implements a nonlinear guidance law (L1 or similar) that commands a target heading or roll
attitude set point to null cross-track error against a path segment.

### `VerticalGuidance` — Altitude / Climb-Rate Hold

Commands target altitude or vertical speed set points to track a target altitude or climb
rate profile.

### `ParkTracking` — Loiter / Station-Keep

Commands the aircraft to orbit a fixed ground point at a specified radius and altitude by
producing heading and altitude set point commands to `Autopilot`.

### Tests — `PathGuidance`

- With zero cross-track error and correct heading, commanded heading set point matches
  current heading (no corrective input).
- With a large cross-track error, the commanded heading correction is bounded within a
  specified maximum bank angle equivalent.

### Tests — `VerticalGuidance`

- With aircraft at target altitude, commanded altitude set point matches current altitude
  (no corrective input).
- With aircraft below target altitude, commanded vertical speed set point is positive.

### Tests — Serialization

- JSON and proto round-trips preserve filter state; next `step()` output matches between
  original and restored instances.
